# Digital-Image-Processing
This project implements Digital Image Processing in C++ using matrix-based operations on PPM images. It applies transformations such as grayscale conversion, flipping, brightness/contrast adjustment, blurring, and rotation. Developed as part of FuzeTek Summer Internship 2025 (Project 5) to apply OOP, file handling, and computer vision basics.
